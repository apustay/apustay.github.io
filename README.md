Capstone Project from Data Science Course

The goal of the project was to take a data set of bank customers who had been approved for a loan at a bank.  It had the results of whether they had paid or defaulted on the loan.  If a customer has defaulted on a loan then the bank incurs a huge cost, so it is critical that underwriters have the appropriate information to review before approval.
