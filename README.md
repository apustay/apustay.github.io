# Hi, I'm Andrew Pustay 👋

I'm a mechanical engineer turned data-savvy analyst, with over a decade of experience across technical services, operations, and product development. Currently serving as a Service and Support Manager in the water and wastewater equipment industry, I'm passionate about transforming technical complexity into strategic, data-driven insights.

I've recently transitioned into exploring more data-focused work, including algorithmic trading, automation, and interactive dashboards using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The goal of the project was to take a data set of bank customers who had been approved for a loan at a bank.  It had the results of whether they had paid or defaulted on the loan.  If a customer has defaulted on a loan then the bank incurs a huge cost, so it is critical that underwriters have the appropriate information to review before approval.
